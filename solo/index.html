mission is intended to perform detailed measurements of
the inner heliosphere and nascent solar wind, and perform close
observations of the polar regions of the Sun.
It was launched on 2020-02-10 and it will use repeated gravity assists
of Earth (2021-11-26) and Venus (2020-12-26, 2021-08-08, 2022-09-03,
2025-02-18, 2026-12-24, 2028-03-17, 2029-06-10, 2030-09-02) flybys
to reach an elliptical orbit between 0.28 and 0.81 AU,
and rise its inclination from 0 to 33 deg.

This site presents results from a research version of the heliospheric code ENLIL
for the BepiColombo mission since its launch.
The 3-D MHD computations were performed on a numerical grid with the 2-deg angular
spacing and they used the WSA coronal maps and CME parameters calculated
and fitted at NASA/CCMC.
The stable ENLIL version is used by NOAA/SWPC and UK MetOffice for official space weather
forecast and by NASA/CCMC for run-on-request support of the space weather community and
for operational support of NASA heliospheric and other missions.

Heliospheric disturbances shown on two panels.
Left panel shows the normalized solar wind density at the ecliptic plane
together with the combined field of views (FOVs) of the Solar Orbiter
detectors (dashed lines), elongations at 20, 40, and 60 deg (solid lines),
and planetary positions.
Right panel shows the running difference (2h cadence) of synthetic white-light
total brightness images viewed from Solar Orbiter together with an approximate
outline of the FOVs of its SoloHI detector shown by dashed lines,
elongations at 20, 40, and 60 deg (solid lines), and planetary positions.
